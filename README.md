# HCFarming
Do you like Stardew Valley? I know I like Stardew Valley, but there's essentially no way to really *lose*. I want to play a version of the game that's hardcore... You know, like a Hard-Core Farming game... Cough cough HCFarming. This is a project to make a farming game akin to Stardew Valley but with difficulty. You'll need to gather your food and preserve it well enough to get through the winter without dying. Inspiration for the game comes clearly from Stardew Valley, but also various Minecraft mods and Vintage Story, a Minecraft-alike that builds on survival.
